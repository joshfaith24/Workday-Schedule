# Workday-Schedule
Using third-party API's and tools like JavaScript, HTML and CSS, the goal is to create a simple
application allowing users to save events in their calenders for the whole day, while also seeing the current
date and time. The user will be able to save and see the events they saved, keeping a daily planner
on their computer and log at all times.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Review
This application developed to help any user be more diligent and planned in their time throughout
the day is extremely beneficial and efficient. There were a couple bumps in the road with JQuery and 
uploading the Day.Js but eventually all the bugs were fixed and the code should run effectively. 
Each user should be able to see each event they saved and what the current date and time is, in 
order to stay more organized.
